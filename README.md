# ProjectMountain
This is the procedural mountain generation system I made for project mountain. 
The goal of the system was to generate a realistic mountain that's fun to climb. 
The system also needed to generate contents such as enemies and other assets around the mountain. 

Some of the main challenges I faced in this project are:
1. Making the mountain look realistic with Perlin noise algorithms. 
2. Generating contents randomly around the mountain without lowering the performance.


I wrote a blog on how I solved these problems you can read here:
